We both studying on SMKN 5 Malang. We are 12 grader, and yeah we'll go to the collage next year, wish we luck! 
SMKN 5 Malang was a decent place tho, isn't the best and isn't the worst. even tho my vocation doesn't have a dozen gaming computer to use, but we have like a rack full of camera, a 3D printer, and some computer. Here's the front image of my school!
